Test-Driven Development approach:
    1. Write the test.
    2. See the test fail.
    3. Get the test to pass by writing the code.

- 'shallow' function from enzyme shallowly compares the React component by just comparing the outer JSX code, not the content inside of it.
- 'it' = (describe the test, the function that runs the test)
- 'expect' = what the test expects to happen
- 'toMatchSnapshot' = snapshots keep recorded history of the component.
